fixing mistakes:

1- split the entery of staff info,
make each one of them in other cout and cin.
 
2- create onther file to save the data of the employees info

3- in display we didn't acknowledge the info listed:
so :
name	id	age	department 	position	salary	email	phone number 
then, display the info

4- check each of the info is it correct, e.g, check if the age entered by the user is digit or not, name is it char?
